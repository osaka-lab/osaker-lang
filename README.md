## What works atm?
uhhh, you can assign an ayumu object to memory (aka assign a variable).
```rust
:o birth_year <-- 1984 ~chiyo
```

then you can inspect that ayumu object:
```rust
:< birth_year
```
```rust
>> birth_year <-- 1984 ~chiyo
```

and when you want, you can remove it completly from memory:
```rust
:3 birth_year
```

> *more coming soon*
